## Technologies

Rails was used for the backend development of this project to handle data fetching and storage with a connection to a PostGreSQL database. Rails is a powerful tool that can be implemented with a simple RESTful API. The front end application was written using javascript's React library for reusable, modular code. It was implemented in conjunction with the Redux framework to add in the benefits of a unidirectional data flow which made the application easier to debug.
